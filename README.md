#Discord-Pac: A PAC-MAN remake as a Discord Bot! 
:ghost::alien::space_invader::robot::white_medium_square::white_medium_square::white_medium_square::smirk:

To add Discord-Pac to your server: 

You'll need the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).

Run on Windows:
```
$ py -3 main.py
```

Run on other systems:
```
$ python3 main.py
```

This project was built for fun/practice using the Discord API/discord.py library so there might be bugs I've yet to fix.
I plan to add and tweak essential features (generate fruits, better ghost AI) and polish as time will allow.

Enjoy!
